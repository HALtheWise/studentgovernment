Any questions? Unsure of how to proceed? Reach out to any members of Student Government's Executive Board (the President, Vice President for Finance, and Vice President of Communications).
As of the 2017-2018 school year, those members are [Sam Myers](https://github.com/sammyers), [Ana Krishnan](https://github.com/askrishnan), and [Evan New-Schmidt](https://github.com/newsch).

## General Formatting

### Wrap Lines at 80 Characters

Lines should be wrapped at 80 characters - this is a fairly common standard for code and plaintext files, dating back to the days of [punchcards](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width#148678).

Here's a good prime number that's eighty digits long:  
`18532395500947174450709383384936679868383424444311405679463280782405796233163977`

### Pull Request Titles

Pull request titles should follow the format:  
**[BA/CA]**-**[school year]**-**[amendment number]**: **[Summary of changes]**

- amendment numbers are iterated for each proposal regardless of success
- amendment numbers are counted independently for the Bylaws and Constitution

For example:

- the first bylaw amendment of the 17-18 school year was about updating CCO procedures and was named:  
  `BA-1718-001: CCO by-laws update to reflect current practices`

### Log Changes in README

A summary of changes should be added to the [README](README.md) in the appropriate location:
- Bylaw Amendments: [StudentGovernment By-Laws>Passed Amendments](https://github.com/olin/studentgovernment#passed-amendments)
- Student Government Constitution: Not yet amended.

### Referring to Positions

Student Government positions should be referred to as follows:

- the President
- the Vice President for Finance
- the Vice President of Communications

## Constitution Amendments

### Title Format for Constitution Amendments (Hypothetical)

## Bylaw Amendments

### Title Format for Bylaw Amendments

Bylaw Amendments should follow the format of _BA-*school year*-*amendment number*_.
For example the title of the second Bylaw amendment of the 17-18 school year is `BA-1718-002'. Amendment numbers are iterated for each proposal regardless of success
